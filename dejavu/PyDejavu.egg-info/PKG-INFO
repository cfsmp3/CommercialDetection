Description: 
        Audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm implemented in Python

        Dejavu can memorize recorded audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting 
        it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input or on disk file, 
        Dejavu attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the 
        database, returning the song or recording being played.
