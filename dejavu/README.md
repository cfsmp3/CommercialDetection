dejavu + commercial detection + alert system
============================================
This repository contains a quick and dirty hack of dejavu to use its audio 
fingerprinting to identify specific commercials (well, any kind of audio
clip, but commercials is what we use it for) in a live TV streaming.

We also use Pusher to send notifications of clients and act of them.

This is not clean code at all. While Deja Vu is really good, the commercial 
system we started with is not really polished, and due to time contraints 
we just added the bare minimum to get things working.

Feel free to clean this up and send pull requests!
